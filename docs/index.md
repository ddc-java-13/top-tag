## Summary

The App purpose would be to: 
1) Determine the odds of drawing an elk tag per game management unit in New Mexico.
2) To use the location and determine travel distance to each GMU.
3) Room for expansion for each game species for New Mexico.

## Intended users

* The first user would be for any elk hunter that would want to increase his/her odds of drawing a tag in New Mexico.
* The second user would be anyone who tries to decipher any over the counter huntable areas for New Mexico, then open up a specific Game Management Unti Map, locate the area, then open up google maps and calculate distances to each GMU.

> As a hunter, I want an app that can decipher game harvest reports, so that I can make better choices of successfully drawing a tag.
> As an hunter, I want to combine multiple apps and screens into one, so that I can easier decipher legal hunting areas, see the location, and determine travel distance in 1 screen.

## Functionality


* Determine legal hunting Game Management Units.
* Look at herd populations
* Compare successful tag draws with the amount of game harvested.
* Quickly locate the GMU on a map.
* Have location data to softly show travel distance.
* Show direct route to the GMU with travel time/distance.

## Persistent data

* Location

## Device/external services

* New Mexico wildlife management website
* Maps
* Satelite for location

## Stretch goals/possible enhancements 


* Would require permission from NM wildlife management, but storing a copy of users hunting and fishing licenses and E-tags.

* Pulling data and compliling from NM wildlife harvest reports
* Incorporating satellite for map/traveling distance.
* Overlay GMU boundaries
* Storing user location
