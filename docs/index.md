## Summary

The App purpose would be to: 
1) Determine the odds of drawing an elk tag per game management unit in New Mexico.
2) To use the location and determine travel distance to each GMU.
3) Room for expansion for each game species for New Mexico.

## Intended users

* The first user would be for any elk hunter that would want to increase his/her odds of drawing a tag in New Mexico.
* The second user would be anyone who tries to decipher any over the counter huntable areas for New Mexico, then open up a specific Game Management Unti Map, locate the area, then open up google maps and calculate distances to each GMU.

> As a hunter, I want an app that can decipher game harvest reports, so that I can make better choices of successfully drawing a tag.
> As an hunter, I want to combine multiple apps and screens into one, so that I can easier decipher legal hunting areas, see the location, and determine travel distance in 1 screen.

## Functionality

List (using a bullet list---or ordered list, if order is relevant) the key functional aspects that will be provided by the app---i.e. tell us what the user will be able to do using the app. This should not simply be a re-statement of the [summary](#summary), but should instead provide a more specific articulation of the functionality and user experience. 

* Determine legal hunting Game Management Units.
* Look at herd populations
* Compare successful tag draws with the amount of game harvested.
* Quickly locate the GMU on a map.
* Have location data to softly show travel distance.
* Show direct route to the GMU with travel time/distance.

## Persistent data

List, in general terms and using a bullet list, what content will be stored on the Android device. This should include any information that users of your app would expect to be maintained (i.e. without connection to a server) across multiple sessions of use. 
* Location

## Device/external services

If the client component will need to access special services of the device (e.g. sensors, contacts, messaging), list them here using a bullet list. Also, if the client component will need to access already-existing external services (e.g. real-time weather data, Open Movie Database, Open Trivia Database), those should also be listed here; any such references to external services should include links to the main page or API description page for the service.
* New Mexico wildlife management website
* Maps
* Satelite for location

## Stretch goals/possible enhancements 

If you can identify functional elements of the software that you think might not be achievable in the scope of the project, but which would nonetheless add significant value if you were able to include them, list them here. For now, we recommend listing them in order of complexity/amount of work, from the least to the most.

* Would require permission from NM wildlife management, but storing a copy of users hunting and fishing licenses and E-tags.

Complexit > Least
* Pulling data and compliling from NM wildlife harvest reports
* Incorporating satellite for map/traveling distance.
* Overlay GMU boundaries
* Storing user location
